The Children Online Privacy Protection passed in 1998, as the only major federal online privacy protection act.  Due to the internet’s lax of regulation, there has been no further advances in privacy protection in 20 years.  The Patriot Act and NSA allowed viewing of telephones, emails, and even financial records.  While some of these were found unconstitutional, the precedent of privacy invasion was set; in 2015, the USA Freedom Act let telephone companies and other institutions maintain personal identifiable information that could be accessed by the NSA with a court order.
Putting this power into the hands of a capitalist market, however, wrought jeopardy upon privacy.  Telecommunication companies hold a plethora of information on each consumer, enough to sell that data for advertising purposes.  Most consumers are not fortunate enough to consider options of service providers.  This monopoly forces consumers to give up their rights in order to maintain a functioning member of society.  Having no choice gives people no rights.
Jobs require technology like cell phones, home internet access, and other devices.  While these aren’t considered unreasonable to most, it requires employees to sign up for services that have invasive privacy policies.  
Technology requirements are beginning to emerge in the education system.  Many schools require students to use school-provided technology such as Chromebooks or iPads to utilize education services that collect personal information.  One school was even caught SPYING ON STUDENTS.  
Lawsuits cost a lot of money
Lawsuits are public
