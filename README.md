# ProjectH
A test project to better learn how to code and use Git.

This is a precursor to KMF's new huge update.

## Current plans include:
- working with tooltips
- resizing text/input boxes
- settings / menu
- log box
- save file
- form file
- update notes
- create a base js file
- use specific js files for specific pages
- create favicon
- clear button
- login box
- remember me checkbox

## Current Issues:

- make log box scrollable

Change `itemKeypress()` to make it a higher order procedure
- no changes have occurred for this yet

## Unsure Features:
- Copyright symbol © or (C).  
(C) works in all browsers while © does not work in Edge
- hide page suffix (\*.html)

## Working Features:
- encryption `encrypt.js`

## Finished Features:

*There are no game-ready features ready for release.*
