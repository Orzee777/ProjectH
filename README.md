# ProjectH
A test project to better learn how to code and use Git.

This is a precursor to KMF's new huge update.

## Current plans include:
- working with tooltips
- resizing text/input boxes
- settings / menu
- log box
- save file
- form file
- update notes
- create a base js file
- use specific js files for specific pages
- create favicon
- encrypt data someway

## Current Issues:

*There are no current issues known at this time.*

Change `itemKeypress()` to make it a higher order procedure
- no changes have occurred for this yet

I am unsure whether I should make the Copyright symbol © or (C).
