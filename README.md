# ProjectH
A test project to better learn how to code and use Git.

This is a precursor to KMF's new huge update.

I hope it works!

Current plans include:
- working with tooltips
- resizing text/input boxes
- settings / menu
- log box
- save file
- form file
- update notes
- create a base js file
- use specific js files for specific pages

Current Issues:

events.js 
- querySelectAll() error for the list / tabs
 forms.js

the following functions don't work and need tested
- getText
- replaceText
- addText
